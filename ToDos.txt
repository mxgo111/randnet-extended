instructions:
set r_dim to be slightly smaller than 784 (600?)
initialize H with DCTDictionary
visualize y
  tensorboard --logdir=../results/test --host localhost --port 8088
visualize r
run network through forward
visualize y hat
visualize r hat
    tune lambda by hand (if y hat is dark, decrease lambda)
try setting phi to be identity (r = 784)
    r should be equal to r_hat, y should be equal to y_hat

compare later with trained network

play around with the lambda for reconstruction
play around with DCTDictionary


training phi in randnet

eventually list out all the different scenarios


Make Phi a convolution?
- with strides that do not overlap

Try VOC dataset for DCT dictionary

use images in path on github
use get_path_loader to display image
use 64 8x8 filters
tune lambda (use for loop)

try tensorboard on computer server - use link by





FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS OF MODEL/CODE:
  - allow for rectangular images
    - e.g. not just y_dim, but y_dim1, y_dim2
  - make stride not equal to 1
    - e.g. put split_image function back
